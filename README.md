[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/s1cushw54324ngjm?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dvoits/z3test)

This repository holds test infrastructure and benchmarks used to test Z3. 

Performance test is measurement of execution of a target command line executable file for specific input file
with certain command line parameters.
For example, a performance test for Z3 is execution of `z3.exe` for the given parameters and certain smt2 file.

An experiment is a set of performance tests for a single target executable and same command line parameters run for multiple input files located in the predefined directory.


# Structure of the repository

* `PerformanceTests.sln` is a Visual Studio 2015 solution which contains following projects:
  * `PerformanceTests.Management` is a WPF application to view, manage and submit performance 
  experiments.
  * `AzurePerformanceTest` is a .NET class library holding the `AzureExperimentManager` class which exposes API to manage experiments based on Microsoft Azure.
  * `PerformanceTest` is a .NET class library containing abstract types for experiments management.
  * `Measurement` is a .NET class library allowing to measure process run time and memory usage.
  * `Z3Domain` is a .NET class library implementing Z3-specific analysis of the program execution.
  * `AzureWorker` is a command line application that is run on Azure Batch nodes to prepare and execute performance tests.
  * `AzurePerformanceTestCommons` is a .NET class library that contains functionality for Azure-based experiment management and is shared by `AzurePerformanceTest` and `AzureWorker`.
